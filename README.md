# Pymaceuticals

Pymaceuticals is a burgeoning pharmaceutical company. They've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

**Task**: Analyze and Visulize the results of an animal study for Pymaceuticals

**Data**: [Animal study datasets](data). In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

**Notebook**: [Jupyter Notebook](pymaceuticals_starter-solved.ipynb)

**Language**: Python; **Packages used**: Matplotlib, pandas, numpy 


### Results include:
* scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
